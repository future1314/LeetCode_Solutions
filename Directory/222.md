#222. Count Complete Tree Nodes  

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.



>for complete tree, if h(l) == h(r) then then the nodes are 2^h -1;


```java
class Solution {
    int height(TreeNode root) {
        return root == null ? -1 : 1 + height(root.left);
    }
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        int h = height(root);
        return h < 0 ? 0 :
               height(root.right) == h-1 ? (1 << h) + countNodes(root.right)
                                         : (1 << h-1) + countNodes(root.left);
    }
}
```
