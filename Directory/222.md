#222. Count Complete Tree Nodes  

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.



>for complete tree, if h(l) == h(r) then then the nodes are 2^h -1;


```java
class Solution {
    public int getHeight(TreeNode root){
        if(root==null) return -1;
        else return 1+getHeight(root.left);
    }
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        int h = getHeight(root);
        if (h==-1) return 0;
        else{
            //右树缺陷
            if(getHeight(root.right)==h-1){
                return (1<<h)+countNodes(root.right);
            }
            //左树缺陷
            else{
                return (1<<h-1)+countNodes(root.left);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
