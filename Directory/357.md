# 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.

Example:

Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, excluding `[11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99]`)

f(1) = 10. (0, 1, 2, 3, ...., 9)  

f(2) = 9 * 9. Because for each number i from 1, ..., 9, we can pick j to form a 2-digit number ij and there are 9 numbers that are different from i for j to choose from.  

f(3) = f(2) * 8 = 9 * 9 * 8. Because for each number with unique digits of length 2, say ij, we can pick k to form a 3 digit number ijk and there are 8 numbers that are different from i and j for k to choose from.  

f(4) = f(3) * 7 = 9 * 9 * 8 * 7....


```java
public class Solution {
    public int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        int res = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i<=n;i++){
            int tmp = 9;
            // j>0 here is redundant, the number with no duplicates should < 10-bit, otherwise there must be a duplicates.
            for(int j =9; j>0 && j>= 9-i+2; j--)
                tmp *= j;
            
            res += tmp;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```
