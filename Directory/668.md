The count function is to find how many numbers in the table are less than or equal to value v.   
For the first row, r=1, the maximum possible c is v/1=v, or n.   
For the second row, r=2, the maximum c is v/2, or n.   
For the i-th row, r=i, the maximum c is v/i, or n.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
    	int low = 1 , high = m * n;
    	while (low < high) {
    	    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    	    int c = count(mid, m, n);
    	    if (c >= k) high = mid;
            else low = mid + 1;
    	}
    	return high;
    }
    
    private int count(int v, int m, int n) {
      int count = 0;
      for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
          int temp = Math.min(v / i , n);
          count += temp;
      }
      return count;
    }
}
```
