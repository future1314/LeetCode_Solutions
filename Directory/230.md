# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note: 

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Follow up:

What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

Hint:

Try to utilize the property of a BST.

What if you could modify the BST node's structure?

The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
