337. House Robber III

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1
     
```
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

Example 2:

```
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1
```

Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

This one has to be recursive, cause you don't really know which is going to be picked during the process.
RobValue(Root)=Max of
  1. RobValue(Root.left) + RobValue(Root.right)
  2. RobValue(Root.left without left child) +
      RobValue(Root.right without right child) + 
      Root.val;
      
The trick of this question is to return a pair of value from recursive call, res[2], first value is the max rob value from the current node, and res[1] is the max rob value without rob current node.

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        return robSub(root, new HashMap<>());
    }

    private int robSub(TreeNode root, Map<TreeNode, Integer> map) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        if (map.containsKey(root)) return map.get(root);
        int val = 0;
        if (root.left != null) val += robSub(root.left.left, map) + robSub(root.left.right, map);
        if (root.right != null) val += robSub(root.right.left, map) + robSub(root.right.right, map);
        val = Math.max(val + root.val, robSub(root.left, map) + robSub(root.right, map));
        map.put(root, val);
        return val;
    }
}
```
