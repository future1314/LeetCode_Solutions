#96. Unique Binary Search Trees

Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?

For example,
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

```
   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3

```

This is a dp question. 
count of 3 =
      * if 1 is root, then count[0] * count[2];
      * if 2 is root, then count[1] * count[1];
      * if 3 is root, then count[2] * count[0];

from above deduction, so empty subtree is one, if take one node as root,  number smaller than root will form left sub tree. and others to form right sub tree.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[0] =1;
        dp[1]=1;
        for(int i=2; i<= n; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<=i-1;j++) 
                dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i-1-j];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
