When we read the third node, now the result r is one of value in the head or second node. We just decide if we replace the value of r as the value of current node(third node). The possibility of replacing it is 1/3, namely the possibility of we don't touch r is 2/3. So we just generate a random number between 0 ~ 2, and if the result is 2 we replace r.
```java
public class Solution {
    ListNode head;
    Random random = new Random();
    public Solution(ListNode h) {
        head = h;            
    }
    public int getRandom() {
        ListNode c = head;
        int r = c.val;
        for(int i=1;c.next != null;i++){
            c = c.next;
            if(random.nextInt(i + 1) == i) r = c.val;                        
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```
