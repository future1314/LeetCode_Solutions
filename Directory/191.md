# 191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

You can simple shift and check, which will be O(32);

This is a O(k) algorithm;

The >>> operator is the unsigned right bit-shift operator in Java.

```java
public class Solution{
    public int hammingWeight(int n){
        int count = 0;
        while(n != 0){
            count += n& 0x1;
            n = n>>>1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```java

n&(n-1) set the lowest bit to 0;
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(n > 0){
            n = n &(n-1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
