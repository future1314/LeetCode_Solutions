# 39. Combination Sum

Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

Note:
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.

The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, 

A solution set is: 

```
[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]
```

question to ask : 
* all positive number.
* will the set contains duplicates ?

backtracking.

> cause the question mention any number can be used many times, so next iteration will need to include this number again, which start from i.

> *BUT* it can not start from 0(i.e. replace i with 0), why ?  cause this will cause duplicates,

> [2,3,6,7] target is 7, if you start from 0 again, will result in [2,2,3] & [2,3,2(start from 0 again)], which is duplicate. 

```java
class Solution {
    List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList();
    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        List<Integer> cur = new ArrayList();
        helper(nums, 0, cur, 0, target);
        return res;
    }
    
    public void helper(int[] nums, int start, List<Integer> cur, int sum, int target){
        if(sum==target) {
            res.add(new ArrayList(cur));
            return;
        }
        for(int i =start; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(sum+nums[i]>target) continue;
            cur.add(nums[i]);
            helper(nums, i, cur, sum+nums[i], target);
            cur.remove(cur.size()-1);
        }
    }
