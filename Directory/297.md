#297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree  

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
Wrong Solution.

```java
//pre-order traversal
public class Codec {
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        buildString(root, sb);
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    private void buildString(TreeNode node, StringBuilder sb){
        //"," : continuous after building left tree
        if(node==null) sb.append("null").append(",");
        else{
            sb.append(node.val).append(",");
            buildString(node.left, sb);
            buildString(node.right, sb);
        }
    }

    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        Queue<String> nodes = new LinkedList();
        nodes.addAll(Arrays.asList(data.split(",")));
        return buildTree(nodes);
    }
    
    private TreeNode buildTree(Queue<String> nodes){
        String str = nodes.poll();
        if(str.equals("null")) return null;
        else{
            TreeNode node = new TreeNode(Integer.valueOf(str));
            node.left = buildTree(nodes);
            node.right = buildTree(nodes);
            return node;
        }
    }
}
```
