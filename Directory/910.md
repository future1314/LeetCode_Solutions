Cause there are two segments (A[0]+K, A[1]+K, ..., A[i]+K, A[i+1]-K, ..., A[n]-K), the first one is on the left of the current point (A[i] + K is the last element of the first segment), the second one is on the right of the current point (A[i + 1] - K is the first element of the second segment). For the first segment, the smallest element is left, the largest is A[i] + K; For the second segment, A[i + 1] - K is the smallest element, the largest is right. Thus, for each point, the largest element should be either A[i] + K or right, the smallest element should be either left or A[i + 1] - K.
```java
class Solution {
public int smallestRangeII(int[] A, int K) {
        Arrays.sort(A);
        int res = A[A.length - 1] - A[0];
        int left = A[0] + K, right = A[A.length - 1] - K;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length - 1; i++) {
            int maxi = Math.max(A[i] + K, right), mini = Math.min(left, A[i + 1] - K);
            res = Math.min(res, maxi - mini);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
