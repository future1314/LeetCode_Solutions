#33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

>ATTENTION 1: since mid can equal equal to left, so >=./////////////////int mid = left + (right -left)/2;
>
> ATTENTION2 : you need first focus on finding the portion of array that is ordered.

Can be same as 88 except return type!!!
```java
public class Solution {
    int search(int A[], int target) {    
        int l = 0, r = A.length-1;    
        while(l<=r){    
             int m = l + (r - l)/2;    
             if(A[m] == target) return m;    
             if(A[m] >= A[l]){    //向左rotate 注意>= 例子 [3,1] 1 -> 1
                  if(A[l] <= target && target < A[m]) r=m-1;    
                  else l = m+1;      
             }    
             else{    //向右rotate
                  if(A[m] < target && target <= A[r]) l = m+1;    
                  else r = m-1;   
             }    
        }    
        return -1;    
    }   
}
```
