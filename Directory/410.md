If(valid), it means that the mid value we pick is too small because we've already tried our best to make sure each part holds as many non-negative numbers as we can but we still have numbers left. So, it is impossible to cut the array into m parts and make sure each parts is no larger than mid. We should increase m. This leads to l = mid + 1;
If(not valid), it is either we successfully divide the array into m parts and the sum of each part is less than mid, or we used up all numbers before we reach m. Both of them mean that we should lower mid because we need to find the minimum one. This leads to r = mid - 1;
```java
class Solution {
    public int splitArray(int[] nums, int m) {
        int max = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int num: nums){
            max = Math.max(num, max);
            sum += num;
        }
        if(m==1) return sum;
        int l = max; int r = sum;
        while(l<=r){
            int mid = l+(r-l)/2;
            if(valid(mid, nums, m)) r = mid-1;
            else l = mid+1;
        }
        return l;
    }
    public boolean valid(int target, int[] nums, int m){
        int count = 1;
        int total = 0;
        for(int num:nums){
            total+=num;
            if(total>target){
                total = num;
                count++;
            }
            if(count>m) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
