balloons = [[7,10], [1,5], [3,6], [2,4], [1,4]]  
After sorting, it becomes:  
balloons = [[2,4], [1,4], [1,5], [3,6], [7,10]]  
So first of all, we shoot at position 4, we go through the array and see that all first 4 balloons can be taken care of by this single shot. Then we need another shot for one last balloon. So the result should be 2.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        if(points.length==0) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(points, (a,b)->a[1]-b[1]);
        int arrowPos = points[0][1];
        int arrowCnt = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i<points.length; i++){
            if(arrowPos>=points[i][0]) continue;
            arrowCnt++;
            arrowPos = points[i][1];
        }
        return arrowCnt;
    }
}
```
