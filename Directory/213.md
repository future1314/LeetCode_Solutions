# 213. House Robber 

Note: This is an extension of [198 House Robber](GoogleEasy/198.md).

After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.


it is a two-pass of related question, first pass, don't rob first house, then the last will opt to rob, then in the second pass, don't rob the last house, then you can rob the first house.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        if(nums.length == 1) return nums[0];
        return Math.max(rob_(nums, 0, nums.length-2), rob_(nums, 1, nums.length-1));
    }
    
    private int rob_(int[] nums, int start, int tail){
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int[] res = new int[tail-start+1];
        if(res.length < 2) return nums[start];
        res[0] = nums[start];
        res[1] = nums[start] > nums[start+1] ? nums[start] : nums[start+1];
        for (int i = 2; i < tail-start+1; i++){
            res[i] = Math.max(res[i-2] + nums[start + i], res[i-1]); 
        }
        return res[tail-start];
    }
}
```
