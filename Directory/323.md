# 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

```
Example 1:
     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4
```

Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.

```
Example 2:
     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3
```

Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], return 1.

Note:
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.


Union-find set algorithms

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        int count = n;
        
        int[] id = new int [n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            id[i] = i;
        }
        
        for(int[] edge : edges){
            int x = id[edge[0]];
            int y = id[edge[1]];
            if(x != y){
                count--;
                for(int i=0; i< n; i++){
                    if(id[i] == x) id[i] =y;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
        
    }
}
```
