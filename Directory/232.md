# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.

pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.

peek() -- Get the front element.

empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.

Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.

You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

```java
class MyQueue {
    Stack<Integer> s1 = new Stack<>();
    Stack<Integer> s2 = new Stack<>();
    // Push element x to the back of queue.
    public void push(int x) {
        s1.push(x);
    }

    // Removes the element from in front of queue.
    public void pop() {
        if(s1.empty() && s2.empty()){
            throw new RuntimeException("EmptyStack");
        }
        moveToS2();
        s2.pop();
    }

    // Get the front element.
    public int peek(){
        if(s1.empty() && s2.empty()){
            throw new RuntimeException("EmptyStack");
        }
        moveToS2();
        return s2.peek();
    }
    
    private void moveToS2(){
        if(s2.empty()){
            while(!s1.empty()){
                s2.push(s1.pop());
            }
        }
    }

    // Return whether the queue is empty.
    public boolean empty() {
        return s1.empty() && s2.empty();
    }
}
```
