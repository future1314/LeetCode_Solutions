dp[i]the number of all possible attendance (without 'A') records with length i :  
end with "P": dp[i-1]  
end with "PL": dp[i-2]  
end with "PLL": dp[i-3]  
end with "LLL": is not allowed  
so dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]  

the number of all possible attendance (with 'A') records with length n:  
âˆ‘dp[i] *dp[n-1-i] i = 0,1,...,n-1
