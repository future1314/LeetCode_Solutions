# 310. Minimum Height Trees

For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

Format
The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

Example 1:

```
Given n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

        0
        |
        1
       / \
      2   3
return [1]
```
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findMinHeightTrees(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<Integer> leaves = new ArrayList();
        if(n==1) {
            leaves.add(0);
            return leaves;
        }
        List<Set<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) adj.add(new HashSet());
        for (int[] edge : edges){
            adj.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            adj.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            if(adj.get(i).size()==1) leaves.add(i);
        }
        //if number of nodes is 1 or 2, the tree cannot be further trimmed
        while(n>2){
            n-=leaves.size();
            List<Integer> newLeaves = new ArrayList();
            for(int i: leaves){
                int j = adj.get(i).iterator().next();
                adj.get(j).remove(i);
                if(adj.get(j).size()==1) newLeaves.add(j);
            }
            leaves = newLeaves;
        }
        return leaves;
    }
}
```
