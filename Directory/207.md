#207. Course Schedule  

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

2, [[1,0]]

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

2, [[1,0],[0,1]]

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.

>Hints:
This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.

>Topological Sort via **DFS** - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.

>Topological sort could also be done via **BFS**.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap();
        for(int i = 0; i< prerequisites.length; i++){
            int p = prerequisites[i][1];
            int q = prerequisites[i][0];
            List<Integer> list = map.getOrDefault(p, new ArrayList<Integer>());
            list.add(q);
            map.put(p, list);
            indegree[q]++;
        }
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList();
        for (int i=0; i<numCourses; i++){
            if(indegree[i]==0) q.offer(i);
        }
        int res = 0;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int c = q.poll();
            res++;
            if(map.containsKey(c)){
                List<Integer> list = map.get(c);
                for (int cc: list){
                    indegree[cc]--;
                    if(indegree[cc]==0) q.offer(cc);
                }
            }
        }
        return res==numCourses;
    }
}
