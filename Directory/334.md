# 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence 

Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists or not in the array.

Formally the function should:
Return true if there exists i, j, k 
such that **arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 **else return false.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Examples:
Given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
return true.

Given [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
return false.

Use two variables, min, seondMin to narrow the search range, initially, both set to MAX_VALUE, min is the smallest number so far, and secondMin is a number larger than min, but after min's position.

```
if val <= min, min =val;
if min < val <= secondMin, secondMin = val;
else return true; val is the third val in the sequence.
```

```java
public class Solution {
   public boolean increasingTriplet(int[] nums) {
        // start with two largest values, as soon as we find a number bigger than both, while both have been updated, return true.
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, secondMin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n <= min) { min = n; } // update small if n is smaller than both
            else if (n <= secondMin) { secondMin = n; } // update big only if greater than small but smaller than big
            else return true; // return if you find a number bigger than both
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
