#154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.


```java
public class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length-1;
        while(l<= r){
            if( l == r) break;
            if(nums[l] < nums[r])break;
            int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            if(nums[mid] > nums[l]){
                l = mid+1;
            }else if(nums[mid] < nums[l]){
                r = mid;
            }else{
                l++;
            }
        }
        
        return nums[l];
    }
}
