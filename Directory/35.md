# 35. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Here are few examples.

```
[1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
[1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
```
Think about the left and right change carefully, why return left is alwasy right?

```java
public class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length-1;
        while(left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            else if(nums[mid] > target){
                right = mid -1;
            }else{
                left = mid +1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
}
```
