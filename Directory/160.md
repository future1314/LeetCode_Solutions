# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.


For example, the following two linked lists:

```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```
begin to intersect at node c1.


Notes:

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
* Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }

        int b = 0;
        ListNode ha = headA;
        ListNode hb = headB;

                ha = ha.next;
            }
        }
        // ping ha and hb to the right pos in the list, so that both has k distance to the end.
        
        while(ha != null){
            if(ha == hb) return ha;
            ha = ha.next;
            hb = hb.next;
        }
        
        return null;
        
    }
