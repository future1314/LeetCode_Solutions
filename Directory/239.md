# 239. Sliding Window Maximum
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

For example,
Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.

```
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```

Therefore, return the max sliding window as [3,3,5,5,6,7].

Monotonic queue, Deque

If an element in the deque and it is out of i-(k-1), we discard them. We just need to poll from the head, as we are using a deque and elements are ordered as the sequence in the array

Now only those elements within [i-(k-1),i] are in the deque. We then discard elements smaller than a[i] from the tail. This is because if a[x] <a[i] and x<i, then a[x] has no chance to be the "max" in [i-(k-1),i], or any other subsequent window: a[i] would always be a better candidate.

As a result elements in the deque are ordered in both sequence in array and their value. At each step the head of the deque is the max element in [i-(k-1),i]


```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums==null || k<=0) return new int[0];
        int[] max = new int[nums.length-k+1];
        int idx =0;
        Deque<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque();
        for (int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++){
            while (!q.isEmpty() && q.peek() < i-k+1) q.poll();
            while (!q.isEmpty() && nums[q.peekLast()]<nums[i]) q.pollLast();//always make sure the head of q is max element
            q.offer(i);
            if(i>=k-1) max[idx++]=nums[q.peek()];
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
