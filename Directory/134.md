#134. Gas Station  

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

>Two problems for this : 
>* if sum(gas) - sum(cost) >= 0, then there is a point you can start and complete.
>* if at certain point k, if sum(gas[0..k]) - sum(cost[0..k]) <0 then k is not possible to begin with, then reset the current sum to 0 , k + 1 will be the result.  

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int station = 0;
        int current = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<=gas.length-1; i++){
            tank+=gas[i]-cost[i];
            current+=gas[i]-cost[i];
            if(current<0){
                current = 0;
                station = i+1;
            }
        }
        if(tank<0) return -1;
        return station;
    }
}
```
