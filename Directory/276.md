# 276. Paint Fence
There is a fence with n posts, each post can be painted with one of the k colors.

You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color.

Return the total number of ways you can paint the fence.

```
  the question is : there can be 2 posts have the same color !!!
```


```
  when n = 1; result = k;
       n =2; result = k*k;
       ------------------------init status;
       count(n) = k-1 * count(n-1) + k-1 * count(n-2);
```

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numWays(int n, int k) {
        
        int dp[] = {0, k, k*k, 0};
        if(n <=2) return dp[n];
        for(int i =2 ;i < n;i++){
            dp[3] = dp[2] * (k-1)  + dp[1] * (k-1);
            dp[1] = dp[2];
            dp[2] = dp[3];
        }
