# 31. Next Permutation

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

```
1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
```

1. find the first pair of index that n[i] < n[i+1], from the end of array.
2. now we are sure from i+1, to the end of array, is a descending sequence, otherwise, we didn't find the correct pair in the first step.
3. from i+1, find the largest index k, where n[k] > n[i],
4. swap k and i, the i+1 to end still is a descending order.
5.  reverse i+1, to end.

```java
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] A) {
        if(A == null || A.length <= 1) return;
        int i = A.length - 2;
        while(i >= 0 && A[i] >= A[i + 1]) i--; // Back to start, find 1st id i that breaks descending order
        if(i >= 0) {                           // If not entirely descending
            int j = A.length - 1;              // Start from the end
            while(A[j] <= A[i]) j--;           // Find rightmost first larger id j
            swap(A, i, j);                     // Switch i and j
        }
        reverse(A, i + 1, A.length - 1);       // Reverse the descending sequence
    }

    public void swap(int[] A, int i, int j) {
        int tmp = A[i];
        A[i] = A[j];
        A[j] = tmp;
    }

    public void reverse(int[] A, int i, int j) {
        while(i < j) swap(A, i++, j--);
    }
}
```
