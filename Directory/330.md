# 330. Patching Array

Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

Example 1:

nums = [1, 3], n = 6

Return 1.

Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.

Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].

Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].

So we only need 1 patch.

Example 2:

nums = [1, 5, 10], n = 20

Return 2.

The two patches can be [2, 4].

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        int res = 0;
        long missing = 1;
        int i = 0;
        while(missing<=n){
            if(i<nums.length && nums[i]<=missing){
                missing+=nums[i];
                i++;
            }else{
                missing+=missing;
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
