# 338. Counting Bits 
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].


Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?

Space complexity should be O(n).

Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

simple solution would be O(kn), where k is the average ones in all numbers. see solution for [191 Number of 1 Bits](GoogleMedium/191.md)



try to derive number of ones in the range [0...16], notice:

1. if i%2 == 1, ones[i] = ones[i-1] + 1;
2. if i is order of 2( i&(i-1) ==0) ones[i] = 1;
3. else ones[i] = ones[i-prevOderOf2] + ones[prevOderOf2];

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] res = new int[num+1];
        res[0] = 0;
        int orderOf2 = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<= num; i++){
            if( (i&1) == 1) res[i] = res[i-1] + 1;
            else if( (i&(i-1)) == 0){
                res[i] = 1;
                orderOf2 = i;
            }else{
                res[i] = res[orderOf2] + res[i - orderOf2]; 
            }
        }
        return res;
        
    }
}
```
