#188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

dp[i][j] is the max profit for up to i transactions by time j (0<=i<=K, 0<=j<=T).
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        if (k >= prices.length/2) return helper(prices);    
        int[][] dp = new int[k + 1][prices.length];
        //elements with index 0 (x and y) are initialized to 0 automatically
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            int debt = -prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + debt);
                debt =  Math.max(debt, dp[i - 1][j - 1] - prices[j]);//This operation is on the same row, meaning same number of transactions
            }
        }
        return dp[k][prices.length - 1];
    }
    

    private int helper(int[] prices) {
        int len = prices.length, profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++)
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        return profit;
    }
}
```
