#371. Sum of Two Integers

Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example:
Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while( b != 0){
            int t = a^b;
            b = (a&b) << 1;
            a = t;
        }
        
        return a;
        
    }
}
```
